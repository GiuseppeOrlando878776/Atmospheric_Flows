# Development of a dynamical core in *deal.II*

Source code for atmosphere dynamics simulations in [*deal.II*](https://www.dealii.org/).
The employed algorithm is described in

> G. Orlando, T. Benacchio, and L. Bonaventura. “An IMEX-DG solver for atmospheric dynamics
simulations with adaptive mesh refinement”. In: Journal of Computational and Applied Mathematics
(2023), p. 115124.

The current test case is a non-linear non-hydrostatic flow over a hill.
